Problem: I have watch many tutorials on a variety of programming topics. I watch something and I have that "aha" moment. I have found myself wanting to review the same videos without having to try and remember where I had found it. Or, I want to recommend it to someone and have to track it down and may or may not ever pass on the information. A lot of my time has been spent trying to search for "that one css grid video." My guess is that I will be watching a LOT more youtube videos over time and want to have a quick way to track one down that made an impression on me.

These could be something as "micro" as a specific javascript array method or a particular react hook. The topic could also be something more "macro"/comprehensive or widely applicable such as using github.

STACK: BACK END - POSTGRES, SPRING, JPA (POSTMAN)
FRONT END - REACT, JSX, BOOTSTRAP (OR TAILWIND)

1.  FIND TEN VIDEOS TO USE AS MOCK DATA FOR FRONT END SO I CAN GET TURNED IN FOR GRADING (RELATIONAL DB WILL FOLLOW). MOCKAPI OR LOCAL STORAGE FOR THESE.

2.  ASSIGNMENT REQUIRES THREE PAGES:

        ONE CAN BE A WATCH PAGE WITH VIDEO TAGS - USE UNIQUE BORDER (OLD TV LOOK?)  MAYBE HAVE A SECTION WHERE A USER CAN TAKE NOTES WHILE WATCHING THE VIDEO AND THEN SAVE OR EMAIL TO SELF.  "COPY" ICON.

        SEARCH PAGE - DEAL HERE WITH THE TOPICS AND CATEGORIES OVERLAPPING - DIVIDE BY AREAS OF THE PAGE - HAVE DROP DOWN MENUS OR POP UPS TO EXPAND OUT ON THE TOPICS, OR SOMETHING MORE CREATIVE.  FOR THE PROGRAMS AND LANGUAGES, USE ICONS, KEEP CLEAN, MORE CLICKING LESS TYPING.  MANY OVERLAPS HERE AND SO KEEP SIMPLE AT FIRST FOR FRONT END WORK.

        QUEUE PAGE - LIST OF VIDEOS NOT YET WATCHED, NOT YET CATEGORIZED OR ADDED TO BACK END.  JUST A HOLDING PLACE FOR LINKS TO GO FOR VIDEOS THAT HAVE EITHER BEEN RECOMMENDED OR THAT I HAVE JUST RUN ACROSS OR THAT I ALREADY KNOW ARE GOOD AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY GET ADDED.  COULD BE SPLIT INTO TWO AREAS.  FIRST, WATCHED AND WANT TO KEEP, NOT YET WATCHED.  COULD HAVE A NOTES SECTION FOR WHERE THE RECOMMENDATION CAME FROM OR WHY I THINK IT SHOULD BE ADDED TO AND WHERE.

        USER PAGE - MAYBE COMBINE WITH FIRST ABOVE
