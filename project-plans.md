Problem: 
I have watched many tutorials on a variety of programming topics. 
Sometimes I have an "aha" moment and something I was not fully understanding suddenly "clicks".
I often can't find my way back to that explanation later in time (or waste too much time looking for it)

This will be something I deal with ongoing as I learn more about new topics (and revisit old ones).
There needs to be a way to organize YouTube videos as my "collection" of "click events" grows.  
It would also be nice to have a place to store links to videos that I might want to watch later.  

I need the links readily available, especially if I want to share with someone else while on a zoom 

I need to be able to search by key words and view by category.  
Categories could be broad, narrow, langauge specific, framework specific, etc.  
An example of narrow would be a demonstration of a particular React hook.  
An example of a more generalized or widely applicable topic would be using github.  


/**********SHORT-TERM PLANS**********/

1.  COMPLETE RELATIONAL DATABASE.
2.  FIND TEN VIDEOS TO USE AS DATA FOR PROVIDING STRUCTURE AND TESTING OUT WHAT IS OR IS NOT NECESSARY OR RELEVANT (try and make different from each other)
    - Data Structure Changes:
        - Add channel link and not just channel name.
        
3.  UPDATE AND REVISE ERD DURING INITIAL BUILD.  
4.  COMPLETE THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF PAGES FOR ASSIGNMENT (WHILE TRACKIN ADDITIONAL POSSIBILITIES FOR LATER).
        a.  WATCH PAGE - WITH VIDEO TAGS (USE UNIQUE BORDER (OLD TV LOOK?)  MAYBE HAVE A SECTION WHERE A USER CAN TAKE NOTES WHILE WATCHING THE VIDEO AND THEN SAVE OR EMAIL TO SELF.  "COPY" ICON).
        b.  SEARCH PAGE - DEAL HERE WITH THE TOPICS AND CATEGORIES OVERLAPPING - DIVIDE BY AREAS OF THE PAGE - HAVE DROP DOWN MENUS OR POP UPS TO EXPAND OUT ON THE TOPICS, OR SOMETHING MORE CREATIVE.  
            FOR THE PROGRAMS AND LANGUAGES, USE ICONS, KEEP CLEAN, MORE CLICKING LESS TYPING.  MANY OVERLAPS HERE AND SO KEEP SIMPLE AT FIRST FOR FRONT END WORK.
        c.  USER PAGE - WILL CONTAIN A VIDEO "QUEUE" FOR WATCHING NEXT,  5 MOST RECENTLY WATCHED? 
        *  Need a "quick store" page to store links until I have time to gather data such as key words.
           Splint into areas such as watched and want to keep, or not yet watched.  
           Quick notes area for things such as whether a specific person recommended it, or a few key words.  
    
5.  COMPONENTS IDEAS (AT LEAST 10 REQUIRED FOR ASSIGNMENT)
    1.  BOX THAT HOLDS WORD OR ICON FOR TOPIC OR PROGRAM - HOVER FOR DETAILS
    2.  QUEUE LIST - USED FOR BOTH LIST TYPES
    3.  NAV BAR
    4.  VIDEO LENGTH CLIPPER / CROPPER - CREATE A FUNCTION THAT TAKES THE VIDEO AND ONLY SHOW RELEVENT    CLIP (EXAMPLE min 2:30 to 5:40 )
    5.  VIDEO DISPLAY AREA
    6.  VIDEO DISPLAY AREA - SCREEN FOR WATCHING
    7.  VIDEO DISPLAY AREA - VIDEO INFORMATION DISPLAY
    8.  VIDEO DISPLAY AREA - USER NOTES AREA
    9.  ON USER PAGE - LIST FOR THE THREE OR FIVE MOST RECENTLY WATCHED???
    10. FUNCTION THAT ALLOWS USER TO TAKE A VIDEO AND ADD IT INTO THE BACK END DATABASE
    11. PROJECT SAVER - LINK ONE OF THE VIDEOS OR ITEMS TO ONE OF THE PROJECTS WHERE YOU WANT TO USE THAT PARTICULAR FEATURE

/**********LONG-TERM PLANS**********/

1.  IDENTIFY THE BEST STORAGE PLACE FOR DATA.
2.  Potentially also have a place for all of my "favorite" coding websites, similar to favorites tab, but  with better visual organization.
